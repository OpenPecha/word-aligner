Rather, it is mostly used to refer to very deferential or submissive behaviour of the body.  In Tibet, one aspect of the culture was that a person could be called up before the དཔོན་པོ local leader (or other superior figure) and abused for their various errors.  When that happened, the lesser person had to stand in a very submissive posture: they had to lean the body forward from the waist and have their head bent and often they would have their hands joined palm together in a supplicatory posture.  They would speak if necessary in a very softened voice and in very respectful and submissive tones.

That turning away from cyclic existence because of seeing it to be un-satisfactory and turning towards emancipation is called nges 'byung for the reason that one has turned one's mind toward obtaining the certainty of having gone to nirvāṇa mentioned in the first meaning.  Thus, although it can be seen why the common translation for this is ",

It is very important to note the term that Buddha used to describe this embodied the positive aspect; the English translation which is almost universally used of the term —",

Since the Buddha spoke of this in such a positive way, and since it is such a crucial term, it would be good to find a new translation that is more accurate both to the meaning and the spirit of the original.Also often called disenchantment, revulsion, aversion, etc., but note from the definition that these are incorrect translations.  It is true that those states of mind are implied by yid nges par 'byung ba but the real meaning of yid nges par 'byung ba is that one has become certain of how things are and hence has become positive of the direction that one will take.

        "  Clarification: The three ancestral kings would offer as much gold as fits in a deerskin pouch to each Indian paita when they requested them to help the Tibetan translators in their endeavours to translate texts from Sanskrit into Tibetan.6. The feature of the greatness of the teachings: The translations of the past were completed at a time when the doctrine of the Buddha had reached its zenith in India. Furthermore, certain tantras did not even exist in the Indian Mainland, but were retained by bodhisatvas, accomplished masters, knowledge-holders and āki īs who had obtained their empowerments.  These were taken from pure lands and from regions of Jambudvīpa such as Si ghala and O iyāna in the West through the miraculous deeds of the great masters Padmasa bhava, Vimalamitra and others, and then translated (in Tibet). Thus, many teachings which were completely unknown to the scholars and accomplished masters of India arrived to become the meritorious fortune of Tibet.Furthermore, concerning the translations themselves: Since the translators of the past were emanations, they established the meaning correctly. Therefore, their works are easy to understand and, on plumbing their depths, the blessings are great. Translators of the later period however failed to render the meaning but made literal translations (merely) by following the arrangement of the Sanskrit texts.  Consequently, their stilted terminology is hard to understand, and on plumbing the depths the blessing is slight. Therefore, they are not the same.",
        "The translator and chief editor was in those days an accomplished scholar who could be trusted.  Nonetheless, a translation had to be in accordance with Sanskrit poetry and grammar when putting it from the Indian text into Tibetan language or back (to check) from the Tibetan text into the Indian language. This was an extremely difficult task.  It meant that each translation had to be re-translated into Sanskrit and had to come out exactly right.  Each text must have been translated in co-operation between the Tibetan translator and the Indian scholar. Then that translation was revised and edited until it was flawless. And finally, the text was finalized as being an authoritative translation, by expounding and studying it. These are the reasons why the translations of the earlier translation period are truly trustworthy."

In particular, he established a huge translation project at Samye with the paits and translators and, over a period of years, caused a complete corpus of buddhist sūtras and tantras to be translated into Tibetan for the first time.  Because of his activities for Buddhism in general and because he was responsible for the first, complete translation of the corpus of buddhist literature into Tibetan, he became known as the second of the three great Dharma kings in the early period of Buddhism being introduced into Tibet.",
        "The youngest of the four sons, Mutig Tsanpo, then ascended the throne in 787 A.D. at which time he received the name Tridey Srongtsen.  He also worked very hard to uphold and propagate the buddhist teaching in Tibet.  Many of the translators and païçits from his father's time were still present and the momentum of translation work with them.  This king invited more great païçits from India and Nepal to assist with the work and, under his patronage, it is said that the remainder of the sūtras and tantras not translated up to that time were translated into Tibetan.  A group of translators called the ",
        " are especially known in connection with the translation work of the time.",
        "King Tridey Srongtsen died in 817 A.D. and was immediately succeeded by his son Tri Ralpachen who continued the family tradition of strongly supporting the buddhist teaching.  He performed many beneficial works for Tibet in general and, in particular, the Buddha's dharma flourished greatly under him.  It is recorded (see the quote in the next section) that he himself said that most of the buddhist texts of both sūtra and tantra had been translated already by his forebears, however the translations that had been made were inconsistent and contained terminology that was not standardized.  Therefore, he decreed that the translators should create standardized terminologies and methods of translation then use them to revise and create definitive versions of all of the translations done up to that time.  These things were done and the various improvements that were made to the language during his reign became collectively known as the second revision to the language.",
        "nine best translators",
        "Because of Tri Ralpachen's activities for Buddhism in general and because he was responsible for producing the fully edited and corrected, definitive translations of the complete corpus of buddhist literature in Tibetan, he became known as the third of the three great Dharma kings in the early period of Buddhism coming to Tibet.  The end of his reign marked the end of the early spread of Buddhadharma in Tibet."

A buddha has appearances for himself and appearances for others.  Of the two, some say that the first is regarded as dam pa'i don the superfactual and the second is regarded as ཀུན་རྫོབ ",

It would be too much to try to discuss it here.Note that this term is not pejorative; it refers to the non-fictional realities that non-deluded beings experience.  More than that, it is complimentary in the sense that the term is used only for the realities of spiritually advanced persons.

At the time of the path, the three vajras, still not fully developed, are referred to individually as vajra body, vajra speech, and vajra mind but these are different from the three vajras of full enlightenment.  The three vajras of the enlightened state are steadfast; they never go through a reversal and become less, hence they are called མི་ཕྱེད (which is translated here as ",

E.g., a noun is modified in various ways to produce the singular, dual, and multiple plural versions of the noun.  E.g., a verb root is inflected to give the various participles of the verb.  E.g., a noun is modified in specific ways to produce the eight cases of a noun.Tibetan language, unlike Sanskrit and English, is a totally un-inflected language.  There are no ",
        " in Tibetan language in the sense referred to by this term.  Consequently, there is no རྣམ་འགྱུར ",
        " defined for the language, either.  Thus, this word is not found in Tibetan grammar texts when defining the language, except to mention this difference, which is one of the key differences, between Sanskrit and Tibetan grammar.  The term is occasionally seen in Tibetan texts where it seems to indicate that there is a ",
        " in Tibetan but in that case it is just borrowing a concept from Sanskrit grammar and applying it loosely to Tibetan language.  For example, in Sanskrit, a noun root is modified in specific ways to produce the singular, dual, and multiple plurals.  This is the true case of a ",
        " that is being ",
        ".  In Tibetan, there are noun words in the language by definition.  These are in the singular already.  To turn them into the plural, they are not modified to give a variant of a root.  Rather, they have another, special word written after them that causes the plural meaning to appear.  Tibetan texts sometimes say that this is like a ",
        " being modified but they only mean ",
        ".  Grammar texts themselves point out that the noun is not a root that is modified.  Rather, it is left as it is and another term is put after it to show a change of meaning.  In Tibetan grammar, this is referred to as a ldog pa gyur ",
        ", not a byings rnam 'gyur modification of a root.  E.g., nyi ma ",
        " is singular.  To make it plural it can have rnams put after it to produce  nyi ma rnams ",
        ".  In Sanskrit, this would not happen; a byings root for all of the forms of the noun, singular, dual, and multi-plural, would be modified to produce three different words, the noun in each of the three degrees of plurality.Furthermore, in Sanskrit, a verb is always given as its root byings and that root is then modified in structure (declined) to obtain the various tenses, the various cases, and the various new words that can be built from that root.  It is similar to a verb always being declared in the infinitive in English grammar and then having the various transformations of that root listed as the various participles.  However, in Tibetan, there is no such thing as a byings which is defined for verbs and which is then modified (declined) to give the various tenses.  Rather, Tibetan simply has different tense forms for a verb which are predetermined as a group without reference to a ",
        " byings from which the various tenses are produced in a methodical fashion.Furthermore, whereas in Sanskrit cases are built by taking the byings and then modifying it to give a case form of the byings "

However, dang is usually used a little differently than the eleven connectors.In standard Tibetan usage, when dang is used to separate multiple items of a list, it is usual to place it just once after the first item in the list and then string all of the remaining items of the list together.  This is similar to the usual English style of writing a list where the members are written sequentially but with the last member of the group separated from the others by ",

Alternatively, to provide more clarity, dang is placed once after the first item of the list as above but then ཤད shad's are placed after each item of the list in order to separate the items, which is effectively the equivalent in Tibetan of writing a comma or semi-colon after each item of the list.  E.g., bum pa'i rgyu ni gser dang /_dngul/_zangs/_rag_rdza las bya 'o/ with the same meaning again.  Only when the sense ",
        " has to be explicitly provided will the dang be written after each member of the list.  This should be understood when translations are being made; just as English has its means of emphasis, etc., when making lists, so Tibetan does too.  The use of an explicit dang after every item in these kinds of lists should be translated with ",
        " because that is the sense being deliberately introduced by the writer, just as much as an English writer would resort to using ",
        " after every item of a list for the purpose of emphasis.Alternatively, when buddhist texts were being translated from Sanskrit and the Sanskrit used the equivalent of dang and placed it after every item of the list, then the Tibetan would reflect that and have a dang in each place.

In the centre of that mansion manifested the dharmakāya great mother surrounded by unfathomable numbers of buddhas and bodhisatvas.  From the heart centre of the great mother, tamer of the maras, ཁྲོས་མ་ནག་མོ Black Wrathful Female manifested as five deities who were seated in the palace over the centre of Oiyāna, the country of the  āki īs.  From the heart centre of Tamer of the Maras, Wrathful Female, the ākinī Serlingma, chief of a ma ala of five deities, manifested then descended into the Oiyāna's Ghandhola palace.  In order to benefit migrators, sentient beings, she appeared after 107 successive lives in the places of gods and men, as Machig Labdron.  Furthermore, she had two births in Tibet as Gyaza and Palza.  Those two coalesced into one was Yeshe Tsogyal after which four manifestations came forth: Machig Zham, Shelza Dron Chigma, Zhang Cham Drochungma, and Labkyi Dronma.This Machig in an outer way is Ārya Tārā, in an inner way is the Great Mother, in a secret way is Vajrayoginī, and in a very secret way is the ཁྲོས་མ་ནག་མོ Wrathful Black Female.  Also, having manifested in the Buddha's retinue as Gangadevi, she showed the way to arouse bodhicitta.Now, what was said concerning her?  As it says in the mdo sde dvangs snyigs 'byed pa ",

The name is not talking of perfection but of completion of all things in one single sphere.Further again, Padma Kalsang Rinpoche of Dzogchen Monastery in Tibet glosses rdzogs pa in this context as yongs su rdzogs pa or chags song ba, with the first term meaning total completion or gone as far as it can go and the second meaning happened or completed.

In addition to the Bodhisattva-caryavatara, the Tibetan scholars ascribe the authorship of two further treatises, the Śhik hā-samuccaya and the Sūtra-samuccaya, to Śhāntideva, although the colophon of the Sūtra-samuccaya clearly identifies Nāgārjuna as the author.",

This Indian Sanskrit scholar came to Tibet in 1204 as part of the entourage of the famous Kashmiri paita Śhākyaśhrībhadra (1127-1225) and wrote a commentary on the Bodhicaryāvatāra in the Tibetan language. That commentary contains a short biography of Śhāntideva.",

When used in this sense it has to be understood as equivalent to འོད་གསལ་བ luminosity and translated appropriately.  This is so important that it is given its own entry below.  2) To be clear in the sense of being unobscured, free of any obscuring factor.  This term is often used in conjunction with other terms to indicate the unsullied clearness of something.  i) It is used in reference to an unsullied, open state of mind, a lucidity of mind.  In particular, there are many མྱོང་ཚིག experiential terms that incorporate it to express the various states of clearness of mind that arise when the obscuring factors of mind are removed.  These terms are met especially in the meditation instructions of the vajra vehicle.  Unfortunately, the basic meaning has often been misunderstood and these terms have been translated with English words referring to the play of light e.g., ",
        ", ",
        ", ",
        ", ",
        ", ",
        ".  However, that does not fit at all with the meaning of gsal ba; it means an unsullied, unobscured openess of mind as opposed to indicating a connection with light or radiance.  E.g., the term གསལ་དབ༹ངས ",
        " is used to describe states of mind that are very free of the usual obscuration and ignorance of conventional mind.  ii) It is used for physical objects.  E.g., the same term gsal dvangs is used to describe things such as water that are without any obscuring or sullying factor, no sediment or other kind of dirt in them.
